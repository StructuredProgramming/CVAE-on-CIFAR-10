This is the code for a Conditional Variational Autoencoder on the CIFAR-10 Dataset, extending it beyond the traditional Variational Autoencoder by giving it generative capabilities. Since the images are 32x32, convolutional layers are implemented along with fully-connected layers.

Here is an image of the CIFAR-10 Dataset:
